MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Projects

The 5 core principles of Cybersecurity are Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication and Non-Repudiation. Cryptography Algorithms are the foundational core responsible for 4 of them with the exception of Availability.

The project is an extension of my Network Security and Advanced Network Security Courses, but a decoupling of my Masters Thesis in 2016 at TMU, by exploring the updated algorithms used for the Secure Enterprise Network Design project. I researched the most secured encryption algorithms currently available in 2023 which are AES-256_GCM and RSA-2048/4096 key size (Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption). Four of the top Secure Hashing Function Algorithms which are (sha512, sha3_384, sha3_512, blake2b). And lastly the secure key exchange algorithm from Diffie-Hellman.

This was written in Python 3.xx programming language for the AI course project.
